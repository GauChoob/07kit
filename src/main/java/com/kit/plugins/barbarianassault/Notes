Put "final" on all constant values


->keep track of points
->Test wave/round data



//Fix wave widget render

Tick/tock draw graphics
Show leech points to avoid blackboard
is30s tick
Bug: end round halfway through doesn't wipe the rest of the round



Ready for release:

BATile
    findAttackSlot takes 50 ms. Somehow make faster? Also remove for loop
Runner
InventoryGraphics
Penance
PoisonTick
    Get color
Cons
GameState
CallWidget
    Make sure WaveInterrupted works
    Verify getInGameWave() works (not necessary for release)
Healer
HealerRole




Does not support arrow waves

    Attacker:
        Highlight correct style to use for all common items/weapons used in current meta based on call
        Mobs spawn/Max mob count/Mobs left to spawn
        Untagged fight/range (purple circle)
        Mob last seen east/south
        Mob aggroed to def/healer
        Healer aggros
        Draw aggro lines for start of wave & later
    Def:
        Eastie runner blocks
        Crashed runners
        Unsafe multi tiles
        Tick counts
        Healer aggros
    Col:
        Points for leech
        Number of left click+total number of eggs

Scroll bug mechanics:
Non-scroll have teammate exited early pop-up: no bug on qs
Non-scroll have points pop-up: no bug on qs
